In a card game, there are n cards with values 2,3,4,…,n+1.

To determine which of two cards with values x and y wins, apply the following rules:

if one of the numbers x and y is divisible by the other, the card with the smaller value wins;
otherwise, the card with the larger value wins.
For example, between cards 2 and 6, card 2 wins because 6 is divisible by 2. Between cards 4 and 6, card 6 wins because neither of these numbers is divisible by the other.

Determine whether there exists a card that wins against every other card.

Input
The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5) — the number of cards in the game.

Additional constraints on the input:

the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3⋅10^6.

Output
For each test case, print YES if there is a card that wins against all other cards, and NO otherwise.

Each letter may be printed in either case. For example, YES, yes, and yEs are all recognized as a positive answer.

Input:
5
2
3
4
5
8

Output:
YES
NO
YES
NO
NO
