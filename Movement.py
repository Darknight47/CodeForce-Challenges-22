There are n+2 positions numbered from 0 to n+1. Initially, position i contains an element of weight wi for every 1≤i≤n, while positions 0 and n+1 are empty.

You choose an integer k. Then every element moves exactly once, simultaneously:

If wi<k, the element at position i moves to position i−1;
If wi>k, the element at position i moves to position i+1;
If wi=k, the entire movement process fails immediately.
An integer k is perfect if the movement does not fail and, upon completion, every position from 1 to n contains exactly one element.

Determine whether a perfect integer k exists.

Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).

The second line of each test case contains n integers w1,w2,…,wn (1 ≤ wi ≤ 10^9).

Output
For each test case, print "YES" if a perfect integer k exists, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive responses.
